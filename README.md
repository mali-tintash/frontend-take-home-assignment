# Frontend Take Home Assignment

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for your interest in working with us! The next step in our hiring process is a virtual code interview. Below you will see 3 questions and a code work section.  We ask you to record yourself answering the 3 questions and sharing your screen presenting the code developed with Loom ([http://loom.com/](http://loom.com/)). Loom is a free video recording software that will provide you links which you will send us. Please send us 1 video link, answering the questions and explaining your code structure.

**Something things to keep in mind:**

- We recommend you do a practice run so that you can get accustomed with Loom's software and our questions.
- Please be sure your audio is clear and your camera is on when you answer the questions. You will need to create a second video that records your screen for the code share.
- Contact me (Jair) if you have issues with the assignment.

# The Assignment
Develop a dashboard interface following the link specifications: [Figma Layout Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/dyQjea3CuFLm14QdFT1rLW/gStudio-Frontend-Take-Home-Assignment?node-id=0%3A1)

# Expectations
- We expect you to read the chakra-ui docs, and use their components to create the interface.
- We expect simple and well written components, always using the hooks from React.
- Your components should receive props that should be typed with typescript.
- If we change the theme, your components should respect it.

# Questions

We expect you to go in-depth on at the following questions:

1. How will you organize the interface components and name them?
2. Will you use a component library to implement charts components? Which one? Explain why.
3. How could you share data and states information between the cards? Tell us about one simple and one complex way and how to decide which one to implement.
4. How would you organize your components in a scalable application architecture providing support to create components variants, and reuse them in a simple and elegant pattern?


# Development Instructions

1. Once you have opened the link you must sign up and log in so you can have access to the colors, fonts, margins and assets information.
2. Develop the interface as close as possible to the mockup.
3. Implement project theme provider, component rules, props and make it able to interact with external data.
4. Test a piece of the codebase. You can choose which part and functions to test.
5. Implement motion/animation transitions for the first card component, on the accordion transition. Surprise us by choosing for yourself which aspects to implement.
6. We recommend you follow strictly our React stack including Typescript, [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro). But it is not a requirement.


# Delivery Instructions

- Open a Pull Request to this Github repository.
- Send a video using [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) answering the proposed questions, explaining your decisions and presenting the code structure.
